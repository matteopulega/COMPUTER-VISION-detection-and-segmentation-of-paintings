# Paintings Detection and Segmentation
A Computer Vision problem: detection and segmentation of paintings, without Convolutional Neural Networks

## Abstract
In this paper we will explain the methodology used to extract paintings from frames
taken from a museum. Our approach is based on the capability of extract the connected components which represents the objects of the frame, construct a mask to isolate each component and then compute some indices that are significant for the discrimination.
